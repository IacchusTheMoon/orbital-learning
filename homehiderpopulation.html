              their attacks are relatively infrequent due to an overabundant source of food. If they end up 
              attacking, it's likely in a scenario where they have you cornered with no escape. Wherever you 
              are, always remember to have at least two escape routes from every place you visit.</td>

              national parks. Be cautious as you visit these areas. Any of these areas that have been found 
              to contain Home Hiders have temporarily been shut down and restricted by law.</td>
