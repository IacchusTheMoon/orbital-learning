            This television series was created for the soul purpose of educating
            kids and adults alike on the many odd and strange beings that inhabit
            our new moon, Iacchus. Thanks to government funding, we can keep
            the public well-informed. Thank you to all of our viewers for
            making all of this possible! In each episode, we will take a trip into learning all about the strange
            life forms that inhabit our new moon. From the vital timing of Memory Shadows to the obscured Home 
            Hiders, our goal is to ensure that you have the proper knowledge you need to keep
            yourself protected from these entities. As always, we keep these as our top priorites:

              I have no idea where I'd be without Orbital Learning! The guides they have given have
              not only helped educate me, but they've saved my life! A few weeks ago I saw my bedroom
              lamp sway ever so slightly. At first, I thought nothing of it, but then I remembered
              their Home Hider episode. I stayed calm and avoided panicking, and the closer I looked,
              the more I noticed that my demise was one wrong move away. Thanks to their advice, I
              managed to slowly escape my room unscathed. I truly owe them everything!" <b>- Survivor

              Until Orbital Learning launched, the sudden appearance of Iacchus in our night sky
              frightened most everyone I know. That's where Orbital Learning came in and helped put
              some of our anxieties at ease so that we now know how to deal with any possible Iacchan
              threats. Ever since Orbital Learning has aired, me and my family have all felt much
              safer with the helpful survival tips they have provided us."
