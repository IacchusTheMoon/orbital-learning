      Did we see Iacchus coming?
    </h3>
    <p class="infopara">
      On October 7, 1989, scientists discovered a new celestial body via telescope.
      It appeared to be roughly 2 billion miles away from Earth, between the distance of Uranus
      and Neptune. Ever since the discovery of Iacchus, scientists have kept a close eye on it and
      have noticed that it wasn't sitting still, nor was it in orbit, but rather it was heading straight
      for Earth. Scientists have theorized that while Iacchus was orbiting it's original star, other
      planets within similar orbital patterns caused Iacchus to be ejected from it's original star
      system and become a rogue planet. That was until it reached Earth's orbit.
      <br>
      <br>
      It's truly amazing not only how Iacchus survived it's trip to us unscathed, but also how its 
      trajectory was just right for it to end up in Earth's orbit rather than colliding with Earth or
      the moon. It seems that scientists were unable to make the discovery of Iacchus public
      before it's arrival in our night sky. The "sudden" appearance of Iacchus seemed to frighten
      and confuse many, so that's why we (Orbital Learning) were given instruction, information,
      and funding from the correct angencies so we could provide all the necessary information
      to the public about the truth of our new and mysterious moon. This isn't to say, however,
      that every fearful reaction wasn't justified.
